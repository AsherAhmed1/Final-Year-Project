This is our Final Year Project.

This is a project in which we have created a web-based video chat app that uses real-time emotion detection through facial expressions and shows them on the right side of the screen and also shows the confidence level of the person. It also generates the transcript of the audio if turned on.

We have trained the LSTM model on 3 different datasets (FER-2013, JAFFE, CK+) with over 500 epochs.
